Master’s in IT, MBA, BCA, Harvard and IIM-A leadership courses, Lean Six Sigma, SCJP 5.0, hands-on coding (multiple languages, frameworks, SQL, AWS setup), design understanding skills (Photoshop, FCPX, Adobe AI, Figma, Canva, etc.), wire-framing and prototyping, and a few online courses to stay sharp.
